# The University of Akron Electronics Club

The University of Akron Electronics Club is designed to inspire undergraduate students with ways of developing their electrical creativity and abilities. Combined with greater Akron, Canton, and Cleveland companies, students can become energized through other electrical engineers.


## Fall 2020 Arduino Game
This year the club has chosen to create 4 Arduino based mini projects.  The COVID-19 pandemic creates interesting challenges. The mini projects allow the club to rapidly adapt to changing conditions while maintaining a rich learning environment that encourages self-research and experimentation. The Arduino game mini project is the second project of the semester.  Club members are encouraged to use the sensors, programming, and 3d printing skills learned so far to create a game of some kind.  This pong game has been created by the club officers as an example for club members.

## Components required

- TFT LCD
- Joystick
- Arduino Uno
